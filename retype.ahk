/**
 * ReTyPe
 * RTP: Emending Your Errors
 *
 * AHK-written software that creates a toolbar within the active RTP Window's titlebar to activate various UI changes and automation
 *
 * Buttons on the toolbar are used to access sub-menus, from which each option
 * will execute an automation script (or some such)
 * The scripts run from menus are (mostly) just UI accessors to macros already
 * accessible by keystrokes
 *
 * USE THIS SCRIPT AND THESE MACROS AT YOUR OWN RISK!
 * Understand that this only emulates keystrokes and that in RTP {Enter} is SAVE so
 * _always_ use alternatives {Tab}{Space} where possible
 *
 * ALWAYS test your scripts on a Training environment before running on Live
 *
 * For scripting help, see http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/
 * For help with hotkeys and modifiers http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm

	; Not forgetting first we've got to delete the old copy.
	; I would love to have this code within the Retype::__New() method
	; but apparently defining a new class whilst still technically
	; defining one isn't liked very much by AHK

; This include is actually evaluated before any other code (all Include commands are)
; meaning that if you change the name of a refill, you must empty the existing file
; rather than deleting it else it will try to be included before it is created
; The first execution after an empty refills.ahk will be broken as it would have
; been included empty.  The second execution will work as expected as the file will
; have been populated with the correct files on execution one.  Comprendes?
